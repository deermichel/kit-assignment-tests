## kit-assignment-tests

Test collection for KIT programming assignments (WS16/17).
Feel free to improve, update, extend or add tests.

### As of assignment 4, tests are based on JUnit and therefore require JUnit being added to your build path.

### Important notice for assignment "3-Tessellation"

Task A1 requires you to add a package declaration to your classes.
In case you don't use the `edu.kit.informatik.tessellation` package for your own classes, make sure to adjust the first line of the TessellationTest.java file!

#### DISCLAIMER: Validity of tests not guaranteed!
